Amazon clone made with HTML and CSS is a front-end web project that mimics the user interface and visual layout of Amazonâ€™s homepage. It uses only HTML to structure the content and CSS for all styling, including the navigation bar, search bar, product sections, and footer, but does not include any back-end functionality or real e-commerce features. This type of project is ideal for practicing web design skills and understanding how to build responsive, visually appealing e-commerce sites using just HTML and CSS.
